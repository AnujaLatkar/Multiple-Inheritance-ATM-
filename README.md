#Multiple Inheritance Using Interface in Java (ATM Machine Example)

---Multiple Inheritance in Java---
In Java, multiple inheritance of classes is not supported.
This means a Java class cannot extend more than one class.
The main reason for this restriction is to avoid ambiguity problems, such as the "Diamond Problem,"
where it’s unclear which parent class method to inherit if they have the same method name.

---Example Context: ATM Machine
Imagine an ATM machine system with multiple functionalities:
>Cash Withdrawal
>Balance Inquiry
>Cash Deposit 
     These functionalities can be modeled as separate interfaces because
they represent different capabilities that a machine can implement.

----Using Interfaces to Demonstrate Multiple Inheritance

Define two interfaces:

CashWithdrawal with a method withdraw()
BalanceInquiry with a method showbalance()
cash deposit with a method deposit()

---conslusion ----
   Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes to avoid 
   complexity and ambiguity issues. However, it allows multiple inheritance 
   through interfaces, enabling a class to inherit behaviors from multiple
   sources safely. This design helps maintain simplicity while providing 
   flexibility and supporting key object-oriented principles like polymorphism.
